# Get to know Netdata's dashboard

Welcome to the first part of the Netdata guide!

This guide assumes you've already installed Netdata. If you haven't yet, check out our [installation
instructions](/docs/packaging/installer) for your system. Once you have Netdata installed, you can hop back over here
and dig in.

## What you'll learn in this part

In this part of the Netdata guide, you'll learn how to:

-   Visit the dashboard
-   Explore available charts (using the right-side menu)
-   Read the descriptions accompanying charts
-   Pan, zoom, select, reset, and resize charts
-   See raised alarms and the alarm log

Let's get started!

## Visit and explore the dashboard

Netdata's dashboard _is_ Netdata. Meaning, it's the most important feature we've built into it. Time to open it up and
start exploring.

Open up your browser of choice. If you installed Netdata on the same system you're using to open your browser, navigate
to `http://localhost:19999/`. If you installed Netdata on a remote system, navigate to `http://SYSTEM-IP:19999/` after
replacing `SYSTEM-IP` with the IP address of that system.

Hit `Enter`. Welcome to Netdata!

## Explore available charts using menus

**Menus** are located on the right-hand side of the Netdata dashboard. You can use these to quickly navigate to the
charts you're interested in.

![Animated GIF of using the menus and
submenus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/63464031-3ee30980-c413-11e9-886a-44594f60e0a9.gif)

Netdata shows all its charts on a single page, so you can also just scroll up and down using the mouse wheel, your
touchscreen/touchpad, or the scrollbar.

Both menus and the items displayed beneath them, called **submenus**, are populated automatically by Netdata based on
what it's collecting. If you run Netdata on a number of different systems using different OS types and/or versions, the
menus and submenus may look a little different for each one.

To learn more about menus, see our documentation about [navigating the standard
dashboard](/docs/web/gui/#menus).

## Read the descriptions accompanying charts

Many charts come with a short description of what dimensions the chart is displaying and why they matter.

For example, here's the description that accompanies the **swap** chart.

If you're new to health monitoring and performance troubleshooting, we recommend you spend some time reading these
descriptions and learning more at pages we've linked to.

## Pan, zoom, select, reset, and resize charts

We built Netdata to be a big sandbox for learning more about your systems and applications. Time to play!

Netdata's charts are fully interactive. You can pan through historic metrics, zoom in and out, select specific
timeframes for further analysis, resize charts, and more.

Best of all, Whenever you use a chart in this way, Netdata synchronizes all the other charts to match it. This even
applies across different Netdata agents if you connect them using the [node menu](../../registry)!

synchronziation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/63464271-c03a9c00-c413-11e9-971d-245238926193.gif)

You can change how charts show their metrics in a few different ways, each of which have a few methods:

| Change                                            | Method #1                           | Method #2                                                 | Method #3                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reset** charts to default auto-refreshing state | `double click`                      | `double tap` (touchpad/touchscreen)                       |                                                            |
| **Select** a certain timeframe                    | `ALT` + `mouse selection`           | `âŒ˜` + `mouse selection` (macOS)                           |                                                            |
| **Pan** forward or back in time                   | `click and drag`                    | `touch and drag` (touchpad/touchscreen)                   |                                                            |
| **Zoom** to a specific timeframe                  | `SHIFT` + `mouse selection`         |                                                           |                                                            |
| **Zoom** in/out                                   | `SHIFT`/`ALT` + `mouse scrollwheel` | `SHIFT`/`ALT` + `two-finger pinch` (touchpad/touchscreen) | `SHIFT`/`ALT` + `two-finger scroll` (touchpad/touchscreen) |

You can interact with charts in the same way using the icons on the bottom-right corner of every chart. They are `Pan
Left`, `Reset`, `Pan Right`, `Zoom In`, and `Zoom Out`.

You can also resize charts by clicking-and-dragging the icon on the bottom-right corner of any chart. To restore the
chart to its original height, double-click the same icon.

height](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/65066675-aec4b100-d939-11e9-9b5d-cee7316428f6.gif)

## See raised alarms and the alarm log

Aside from performance troubleshooting, Netdata is designed to help you monitor the health of your systems and
applications. That's why every Netdata installation comes with dozens of pre-configured alarms that trigger alerts when
your system starts acting strangely.

Find the **Alarms** button in the top navigation bring up a modal that shows current raised alarms, all running alarms,
and the alarms log.

Here's an example of raised `disk_space._` and `disk_space._home` alarms, followed by the full list and alarm log:

![Animated GIF of looking at raised alarms and the alarm
log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/63468773-85d5fc80-c41d-11e9-8ef9-51bee0f91332.gif)

Let's look at one of those raised alarms a little more in depth. Here's a static screenshot:

![Screenshot of a raised disk_space.\_
alarm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/63468853-af8f2380-c41d-11e9-9cec-1b0cac5d5549.png)

The alarm itself is named **disk - /**, and its context is `disk_space._`. Beneath that is an auto-updating badge that
shows the latest metric: 28.4% disk space usage.

With the three icons beneath that and the **role** designation, you can **1)** scroll to the chart associated with this
raised alarm, **2)** copy a link to the badge to your clipboard, and **3)** copy the code to embed the badge onto
another web page using an `<embed>` element.

The table on the right-hand side displays information about the alarm's configuration.

In this example, Netdata triggers a warning alarm when any disk on the system is more than 20% full. Netdata triggers a
critical alarm when the disk is more than 30% full.

The `calculation` field is the equation used to calculate those percentages, and the `check every` field specifies how
often Netdata should be calculating these metrics to see if the alarm should remain triggered.

The `execute` field tells Netdata how to notify you about this alarm, and the `source` field lets you know where you can
find the configuration file, if you'd like to edit its configuration.

We'll cover alarm configuration in more detail later in the tutorial, so don't worry about it too much for now! Right
now, it's most important that you understand how to see alarms, and parse their details, if and when they appear on your
system.
