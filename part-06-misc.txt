To configure Netdata to monitor as many Nginx servers, you will edit the Nginx configuration file with the following command:

```sh
/etc/netdata/edit-config python.d/nginx.conf
```

Be sure to have the `ngx_http_stub_status_module` active on any servers you want to monitor.

You can proceed to monitor as many Nginx servers as you need by editing the `python.d/nginx.conf` file:

At the near bottom of the file you will see the below uncommented:

```yaml
localhost:
  name: "local"
  url: "http://localhost/stub_status"

localipv4:
  name: "local"
  url: "http://127.0.0.1/stub_status"

localipv6:
  name: "local"
  url: "http://[::1]/stub_status"
```

You can add more

```yaml
RemoteNginx:
  name: "Reverse_Proxy"
  url: "http://yourdomain.com/stub_status"
```

`RemoteNginx` will show up in Netdata logs. `Reverse Proxy` will show up in the menu in the nginx section.

This same procedure works when you want to view metrics of other services like Apache, Redis, Memcached and other services supported by the [`python.d` orchestrator](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/collectors/python.d.plugin).

After making changes to the respective configuration file, always restart `netdata.service`.

<!-- ### Using `go.d.plugin`

Netdata is in process of migrating collectors from `python` to `go`.

The configuration at the moment are incompatible. As a temporary solution, all modules rewritten in go are disabled by default.

Previously you enabled Nginx metrics on your Netdata dashboard through the `python.d.plugin` orchestrator, to achieve this with the `go.d.plugin` alternative, you have to do the following:

- Explicitly disable python module in `python.d.conf`
  run this command:

```sh
/etc/netdata/edit-config python.d.conf
```

Find the module of the service, Nginx is used as an example in this tutorial.

You will see it commented and activated by default:

```yaml
# nginx: yes
```

Uncomment and disable it:

```yaml
nginx: no
```

- explicitly enable go module in `go.d.conf`

run this command:

```sh
/etc/netdata/edit-config go.d.conf
```

You will see the module of the service, Nginx, for this tutorial, commented and activated by default.

```yaml
# nginx: yes
```

Uncomment that line so it looks like this:

```yaml
nginx: yes
```

- move `python` module jobs to `go` module configuration file (change syntax, see go module configuration file for details).

* restart `netdata.service` -->




Netdata collects system metrics by itself. It has many internal plugins for collecting most of the metrics presented by default when it starts, collecting data from `/proc`, `/sys` and other Linux kernel sources.

To collect non-system metrics, Netdata supports a plugin architecture known as plugin orchestrator.

Plugin orchestrators are external plugins that do not collect any data by themselves. Instead, they support data collection modules written in the language of the orchestrator.

They also make it easier to develop plugins and minimize the number of threads and processes running.

Currently, Netdata provides plugin orchestrators BASH v4+ charts.d.plugin, node.js node.d.plugin, python v2+ (including v3) python.d.plugin and two more are actively being developed (go and java)

Netdata supports both **internal** and **external data collection** plugins

## Internal plugins

These plugins are written in C and run as threads inside the `netdata` daemon. Once this thread has started, the plugin may spawn additional threads according to its design.

An example of this is the `cgroups.plugin`, written in C which collects resource usage of Containers, libvirt VMs and systemd services, on Linux systems.

## External plugins

External plugins may be written in just about any programming language and are spawned as long-running independent processes by the `netdata` daemon.

They communicate with the netdata daemon via pipes (stdout communication).

A good example is `fping.plugin`, written in C, which measures network latency, jitter, and packet loss between the monitored node and any number of remote network endpoints.

## The difference between internal and external plugins?

A significant difference between these two types of plugins is that external plugins depend on plugins.d - the Netdata internal plugin that collects metrics from external processes.





`plugins.d` manage all external plugins, which provides additional management options.

## Add a new external plugin to Netdata

Before you proceed to add a new external plugin to Netdata, you need to install the required libraries and packages from the package manager of your system.

To install `nfacct.plugin` for example, you need to

- install `libmnl-dev` and `libnetfilter_acct-dev` using the package manager of your system.

- re-install Netdata from source. The installer will detect that the required libraries are now available and will also build netdata.plugin

Some external plugins like `nfacct.plugin` require `root` access, so the plugins are `setuid` to `root`

`nfacct.plugin` is installed and activated once the build from source is completed.

You can disable NFACCT for Netdata by editting `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf` and adding this:

```conf
[plugins]
    nfacct = no
```
