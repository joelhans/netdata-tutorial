There are a few common issues at this point. Let's see if we can't find a solution for you.

**Verify Netdata is running.** Open an SSH session to the server and execute `sudo ps -e | grep netdata`. You should see a response in the form of the PID of the Netdata daemon. If you get no response Netdata isn't running.

```
1210 ?        00:02:15 netdata
```

**Verify that Netdata responds to HTTP requests.**

Using the same ssh session, execute `curl -Ss http://localhost:19999`. It should dump on your screen the `index.html` page of the dashboard. If it does not, check the [installation page](../packaging/installer) to install it.

**Verify Netdata receives the HTTP requests.**

On the same ssh session, execute `tail -f /var/log/netdata/access.log` (if you installed the static 64bit package, use: `tail -f /opt/netdata/var/log/netdata/access.log`). This command will print on your screen all HTTP requests Netdata receives.

Next, try to access the dashboard using your web browser, using the URL posted above. If nothing is printed on your terminal, the HTTP request is not routed to your Netdata.

If you are not sure about your server IP, run this for a hint: `ip route get 8.8.8.8 | grep -oP " src [0-9\.]+ "`. It should print the IP of your server.

If still Netdata does not receive the requests, something is blocking them. A firewall possibly. Please check your network.
