# Monitor more than one system with Netdata

By design, Netdata is a _distributed_ application. It runs on, and monitors, only a single system. That means you can
install many Netdata agents on all your servers, containers, and edge/IoT devices.

We made this decision a long time ago to [improve security and performance](/tutorials/part-01/).

To use Netdata to monitor more than a single system, install it on each one. Each Netdata agent runs independently and,
by default, doesn't send its metrics from one system to another.

> We'll cover _streaming_, which allows you to send metrics from one system to another, in the last part of this 
> tutorial.

At this point, you might be thinking, "So, now I have to remember all these IP addresess, and type them into my browser
manually, just to move from one system to another? Maybe I should just make a bunch of bookmarks. What's a few more tabs
on top of the hundred I have already? ðŸ¤¬"

The good news is that none of this is necessary. Netdata is _distributed_, but is also built to help you move seamlessly
between any number of Netdata agents, and the systems they monitor. This is possible thanks to [Netdata
Cloud](../netdata-cloud/README.md).

## What you'll learn in this part

In this part of the Netdata guide, we'll talk about why you should use Netdata Cloud, and then you'll learn how to:

-   Add nodes to your Netdata Cloud account 
-   Navigate between your nodes via the **My nodes** menu 
-   Use essential features in the Nodes View

## Why use Netdata Cloud?

We built Netdata Cloud to give users a way to bridge the gap between many distributed agents running concurrently, all
without creating a centralized database for all your systems' metrics.

> monitoring_](https://blog.netdata.cloud/posts/netdata-cloud-announcement/).

Netdata Cloud gives you a better way to observe and take action on slowdowns, anomalies, or outages in your systems and
applications. It connects all your Netdata agents through your _web browser_, allowing you to move between different
nodes quickly and use the Nodes View to see a handful or hundreds of Netdata-monitored nodes on a single screen.

So, if you have more than one system that's being monitored by Netdata, and you aren't at a workplace with strict data
requirements, Netdata Cloud will deliver you all the benefits of a centralized monitoring infrastructure while
maintaining the benefits of its distributed nature.

It's the best of both worlds!

And, better yet, Netdata Cloud doesn't store any of your system's metrics. It stores _metadata_ about the system's IP,
hostname, and a randomly-created GUID, and nothing else. Metrics are streamed from your systems directly to your _web
browser_.

Essentially, your web browser hosts a SaaS application with all of Netdata Cloud's features embedded right into the
dashboard itself.

## Add nodes to your Netdata Cloud account

The best way to add nodes to your Netdata Cloud account is to click on the **Sign in** button on the top-right corner of
your Netdata dashboard.

That button will open a new tab in for Netdata Cloud, and will prompt you to log-in using email or authentication via
Google or GitHub. Choose your preferred method.

If you chose email, Netdata Cloud will send you a "magic link" via email. Once you click on the link, that node will be
connected to your Netdata Cloud account and you'll be redirected back to your dashboard.

If you chose Google or GitHub, you'll be redirected back to your dashboard as soon as authentication is finished.

Here's what authentication via Google looks like:

Depending on your authentication method, your email address or name will appear in the top right of your dashboard
instead of the **Sign in** button.

At this point, you've successfully added a single Netdata agent to your Netdata Cloud account. _What about the rest?_

Well, you'll

## Navigate between your nodes via the My nodes menu

To show all your servers in that menu, you need to [register for or sign in](netdata-cloud/signing-in.md) to [Netdata
Cloud](netdata-cloud/) from each system. Each system will then appear in the **My nodes** menu, which you can use to
navigate between your systems quickly.

![Animated GIF of the My Nodes menu in

Whenever you pan, zoom, highlight, select, or pause a chart, Netdata will synchronize those settings with any other
agent you visit via the My nodes menu. Even your scroll position is synchronized, so you'll see the same charts and
respective data for easy comparisons or root cause analysis.

You can now seamlessly track performance anomalies across your entire infrastructure!
