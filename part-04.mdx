# The basics of configuring Netdata

Welcome to the fourth part of the Netdata tutorial.

Since the beginning, we've covered the building blocks of Netdata, dashboard basics, and how you can monitor many
individual systems using many distributed Netdata agents.

Next up: configuration.

## What you'll learn in this part

We'll talk about Netdata's default configuration, and then you'll learn how to do the following:

-   Find your `netdata.conf` file
-   Use edit-config to make changes to `netdata.conf`
-   Store more metrics using the database engine
-   Disable an alarm
-   Enable TLS for improved security

## Find your `netdata.conf` file

Netdata primarily uses the `netdata.conf` file for custom configurations.

On most systems, you can find that file inside the `/etc/netdata/` directory. Some operating systems will place
configuration files in the `/opt/netdata/etc/netdata/` directory instead. Be sure to check there if you find nothing at
`/etc/netdata/`.

You can also look at our [installation instructions](../../packaging/installer/) for details on where your configuration
files might be located.

For the rest of this tutorial, we'll assume you're editing files or running scripts from _within_ your **Netdata
directory**.

## Use edit-config to make changes to `netdata.conf`

Inside your Netdata directory there is a helper scripted called `edit-config`. This script will open existing Netdata
configuration files using a text editor. Or, if the configuration file doesn't yet exist, the script will copy an
example file from `/usr/lib/netdata/conf.d/` to your Netdata directory and then allow you to edit it before saving.

> `edit-config` will use the `EDITOR` environment variable on your system to edit the file. On many systems, that is
> defaulted to `vim` or `nano`. We highly recommend `nano` for beginning users. To change this variable for the current
> session (it will be reset when you reboot), export a new value: `export EDITOR=nano`.

Let's give it a shot. Navigate to your Netdata directory and run `edit-config` using `sudo` to edit `netdata.conf`:

```bash
cd /etc/netdata    # Replace this path with your Netdata directory
sudo ./edit-config netdata.conf
```

You'll see that `netdata.conf` is a `name = value` dictionary. Most lines are **commented**, in that they start with a
hash symbol (`#`) and thus are ignored by Netdata when it loads the configuration file. Netdata will add a comment to
any settings it doesn't recognize or isn't using.

This means that to _enable_ any setting, you need to **uncomment** it by removing that hash.

Let's add a fake option to show you how Netdata loads its configuration. Add a `test` option under the `[global]`
section and give it the value of `1`.

```conf
[global]
    test = 1
```

Restart Netdata with `service restart netdata` or the [appropriate alternative](../getting-started.md) for your system.

Now, open up your browser and navigate to `http://HOST-IP:19999/netdata.conf`. You'll see that Netdata has recognized
that our fake option isn't valid and added a notice that it will be ignored.

Here's the process in GIF form!

## Example: Rename your Netdata agent

The `netdata.conf` file is broken up into various sections, such as `[global]`, `[web]`, and `[registry]`. Each section
contains a number of options that you can configure.

Let's start with an easy one: switching the `hostname` option, thereby "renaming" your Netdata agent on the dashboard
and a handful of other places, like the **My nodes** menu.

Use `edit-config` to change the `hostname` option to your preferred name. Be sure to uncomment it!

```conf
[global]
    hostname = hello-world
```

Once you're done, restart Netdata and refresh the dashboard. Say hello to your renamed agent!

## What's next?

At this point, you should be comfortable with getting to your Netdata directory, opening and editing `netdata.conf`, and
seeing your changes reflected in the dashboard.

Netdata has many more configuration files that you might want to change, but we'll cover those in the following parts of
this tutorial.

In the next part, we're going to cover one of Netdata's core functions: monitoring the health of your systems via alarms
and notifications. You'll learn how to disable alarms, create new ones, and push notifications to the system of your
choosing.
