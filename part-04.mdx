# The basics of configuring Netdata

Welcome to the fourth part of the Netdata tutorial.

Since the beginning, we've covered the building blocks of Netdata, dashboard basics, and how you can monitor many
individual systems using many distributed Netdata agents.

Next up: configuration.

## What you'll learn in this part

We'll talk about Netdata's default configuration, and then you'll learn how to do the following:

-   Find your `netdata.conf` file
-   Use edit-config to make changes to `netdata.conf`
-   Store more metrics using the database engine
-   Disable an alarm
-   Enable TLS for improved security

## Find your `netdata.conf` file

Netdata primarily uses the `netdata.conf` file for custom configurations.

On most systems, you can find that file inside the `/etc/netdata/` directory. We'll call that the **Netdata directory**.

> Some operating systems will place configuration files in the `/opt/netdata/etc/netdata/` directory instead. Be sure to
> check there if you find nothing at `/etc/netdata/`.

## Use edit-config to make changes to `netdata.conf`

Inside your Netdata directory there is a helper scripted called `edit-config`. This script will open existing Netdata
configuration files using a text edito

Use a text editor, like `nano` or `vim`, to open your `netdata.conf` file.

The `netdata.conf` file is broken up into various sections, such as `[global]`, `[web]`, and `[registry]`. 



By default, most options are commented, so you'll have to uncomment them (remove the `#`) for Netdata to recognize your
change.

Once you save your changes, [restart Netdata](../getting-started.md#start-stop-and-restart-netdata) to load your new configuration.
