# The comprehensive Netdata tutorial

Welcome to Netdata! We're glad you've decided to use our health monitoring and performance troubleshooting system.

This tutorial is designed to help beginners understand what Netdata is, what it's capable of, and how it'll help you
learn more about your systems and applications. If you're new to Netdata, or have never tried health
monitoring/performance troubleshooting systems before, this tutorial is perfect for you.

> If you have monitoring experience, or simply would rather get straight into configuring Netdata to your needs, you can
> also jump straight into code and configurations with the [getting started guide](../GettingStarted.md).

This tutorial is very much an in-progress effort, so stay tuned for more. If you'd like to contribute, visit our
