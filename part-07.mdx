# Netdata's dashboard in depth

Welcome to the seventh part of the Netdata guide!

This guide assumes your dashboard is running and you are familiar with it. 

This part of the guide aims to get you more familiar with the features of the dashboard not previously mentioned in
earlier parts of the guide.

## What you'll learn in this part

In this part of the Netdata guide, you'll learn how to:

-   Change the dashboard's settings
-   Check if there's an update to Netdata
-   Export or import a snapshot

Let's get started!

## Change the dashboard's settings

The settings area at the top of your Netdata dashboard houses browser settings. These settings do not affect the
operation of your Netdata server/daemon. They take effect immediately and are permanently saved to browser local storage
(except the refresh on focus / always option).

You can see the **Performance**, **Synchronization**, **Visual**, and **Locale** tabs on the dashboard settings modal.

To change any setting, click on the toggle button.

We recommend you spend some time reading the descriptions for each setting to understand them before making changes.

Pay particular attention to the following settings, as they have dramatic impacts on the performance and appearance of your Netdata dashboard:

-   When to refresh the charts?
-   How to handle hidden charts?
-   Which chart refresh policy to use?
-   Which theme to use?
-   Do you need help?

Some settings are applied immediately, and others are only reflected after you refresh the page.

## Check if there's an update to Netdata

Netdata upon installation with [the one-liner](https://docs.netdata.cloud/packaging/installer/#one-line-installation) 
comes with the auto-update option enabled by default.

You can always check if there is an update available right from the **Update** area of your Netdata dashboard.

If an update is available, you'll see a modal similar to the one above.

Netdata automatically updates itself, but if you choose to update it manually, there are [several well-documented methods](https://docs.netdata.cloud/packaging/installer/update/) to achieve that. 
However, it is best practice for you to first go over the [changelog](https://docs.netdata.cloud/changelog/).

## Export or import a snapshot

Netdata can export and import snapshots of the contents of your dashboard at a given time. Any Netdata agent can import the snapshot of any other Netdata agent. 

Snapshot files include all the information of the dashboard, including the URL of the origin server, its unique
ID, and chart data queries for the visible timeframe, to align, pan, and zoom the charts as needed. Snapshots are not in
real-time.

To export a snapshot, click on the **export** icon.

Edit the snapshot file name and select your desired compression method. Click on **Export**.

When the export is complete, your browser will prompt you to save the `.snapshot` file to your machine. You can now share this file with any other Netdata user via email, Slack, or even to help describe your Netdata experience when [filing an issue](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

To import a snapshot, click on the **import** icon.

![Animated GIF of opening the import modal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12263278/64901503-ee696f80-d691-11e9-9678-8d0e2a162402.gif)

Select the Netdata snapshot file to import. Once the file is loaded, the dashboard will update with critical information about the snapshot and the system from which it was taken. Click **import** to render it.

Your Netdata dashboard will load data contained in the snapshot into charts. Because the snapshot only covers a certain
period of time, it won't update with new metrics.

An imported snapshot is also temporary. If you reload your browser tab, Netdata will remove the snapshot data and
restore your real-time dashboard for your machine.
