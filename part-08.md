# Build your first custom dashboard
<!-- Goal: 	Given the popularity of the custom dashboards page, we need to help new users easily create new custom pages. This part will be more like a mini-tutorial on quickly setting up new users with a custom dashboard, rather than supplying all of the available options, as the custom dashboards page does. -->

## Create a custom-dashboard.html file

## Add dashboard.js

## Set the default Netdata server

## Create a chart, set its duration and size
